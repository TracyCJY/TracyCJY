# Introduction
challenges: they may recognize the need to be able to communicate effectively with data but feel like they lack expertise in this space. This can be a long and tedious process.    
I initially recognized the importance of being skilled in the data analysis area during my first job out of college. I was working as an e-commerce operator. My job was to plan and execute integrated online and offline marketing events. The whole process including plan, coordinate, execute, and the most important part- business analysis. Although the analysis process doesn't require sophisticated algorithm models, we need strong data acumen to act timely plan based on data analysis and visualization. For me, that was the beginning of seeing value in data analysis in business sector and I got highly satisfaction seeing the real outcome of implementing insights from analysis. After progressing through various working roles in an O2O company and cross-border ecommerce as an operator assoicate, followed the postgraduate degree, I decided I wanted to continue my career in the business analyst role. During the one year postgraduate time, I paused to reflect on the skills I possessed that I wanted to be: at the core, it was using data to influence business decisions.    
**six key lessons**   
**1. understand the context**   
Before you start down the path of data visualization, there are a couple of questions that you should be able to concisely answer: Who is your audience? What do you need them to know or do? This chapter describes the importance of understanding the situational context, including the audience, communication mechanism, and desired tone. A number of concepts are introduced and illustrated via example to help ensure that context is fully understood. Creating a robust understanding of the situational context reduces iterations down the road and sets you on the path to success when it comes to creating visual content.   
**2. choose an appropriate visual display**   
Simple text, table, heatmap, line graph, slopegraph,vertical bar chart, vertical stacked bar chart, waterfall chart, horizontal bar chart, horizontal stacked bar chart, and square area graph    
**3. eliminate clutter**    
Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception, how we can apply them to visual displays of information such as tables and graphs.  
**4. focus attention where you want it**    
sight and memory that will act to frame up the importance of preattentive attributes like size, color, and position on page.    
**5. think like a designer**    
product design has clear application to communicating with data. when it comes to the form and function of data visualizations, we first want to think about what it is we want our audience to be able to do with the data and create a visulization that will allow for this with ease.     
**6. dissecting model visuals**   
Five exemplary visuals and discuss the specific thought process and design choices that led to their creation, utilizing the lessons covered up to this point. We explore decisions regarding the type of graph and ordering of data withing the visual. We consider choices around what and how to emphasize and de-emphasize through use of color, thickness of lines, and relative size. We discuss alignment and positioning of components within the visuals and also the effective use of words to title, label, and annotate.    
**7. tell a story**   
Stories resonate and stick with us in ways that data alone cannot. A story has a clear beginning, middle, and end; we discuss how this framework applies to and can be used when constructing business presentations. 
# The importance of context
## Exploratory vs. explanatory analysis
Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others. When we do exploratory analysis, it's like hunting for pearls in oysters. However, when we are at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, we really want to be in the explanatory space, meaning we have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell
